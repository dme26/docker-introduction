# Containers for reproducible research

This is not an official Carpentries lesson, but the Carpentries lesson template is excellent, so I am using it.

This lesson is now within the Software Carpentries incubator: https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/docker-introduction and it is likely that ongoing development should proceed there.

This material was first used to run the session "An introduction to containers (Docker specifically)" at ResBaz Dunedin 2019.
